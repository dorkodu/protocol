# Subtext guide

- **Status**: Draft

Subtext is markup for note-taking. It aims to add just the tiniest bit of structure on top of plain text, to make notes more useful.

**Warning**: Subtext is an experiment, NOT a finished language proposal. We are actively putting it through its paces using practical prototypes. It may change in radical and breaking ways between now and a first stable release.

## Introduction

Subtext is a text-based, line-oriented hypertext format, designed for note-taking.

Subtext markup is made up of ordinary lines of text, which are interpreted as a list of blocks. Lines that are prefixed with magic "sigil" characters are treated as special blocks. Lines without sigils are treated as text blocks. Empty lines are ignored. Here's a quick sample:

```
# Heading

Plain text.

- List item
- List item

> Quoted text

URLs like https://example.com are automatically linked.

You can also link to local pages using short /slashlinks.
```

Subtext is barely thereâ€”just the tiniest bit of formatting on top of plain text. More importantly, Subtext adds structure to plain text so you can build tools to do more with it. Things like:

- Excerpt a document by taking the first text block
- Select all quotes from a collection of documents
- Select all links, and generate a link graph for a collection of documents
- Find all backlinks and append them to the document as links

Subtext is designed to be used in a wide range of settings, from simple command-line utilities, to advanced clients. It is extremely easy to parse, and can be rendered in a single pass, or even streamed.

## Blocks

### Text blocks

One line is one block in Subtext. This means you write text the way you would anyway. For example, here are two blocks:

```
Delays in systems cause waves.

You can only smooth them out with stocks that match the scale of the delay-waves.
```

One line is one block, so blank lines are optional. This is also two blocks:

```
Block 1
Block 2
```

Blank lines have no meaning in Subtext, but can be added between any blocks, for source code readability.

Usually, it's nice to put a blank line between text blocks for readability reasons.

### Heading blocks

Heading blocks start with a `#`

```
# This is a heading

Text underneath.
```

The space after the `#` is optional, but it's nice to include it for readability.

```
#This is also a heading
```

### List blocks

List blocks start with a `-`

```
- List item
- List item
- List item
```

The space after the `-` is optional, but it's nice to include it for readability.

### Quote blocks

Quote blocks start with a `>`

```
> Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.
```

The space after the `>` is optional, but it's nice to include it for readability.

## Links

Subtext will detect any http URLs, and automatically link them.

```
Links like https://example.com will be automatically linked.
```

Note you must include the protocol (the `http://` bit) for Subtext to sniff out the URL.

Subtext parsers can automatically detect `http` links this way, but not every protocol will work. For exotic protocols wrap the URL in `<` `>` angle brackets.

```
Link unusual URLs like <doi:10.1000/182> by wrapping them in angle brackets. 

This works for any kind of URL <https://example.com>.
```

## Slashlinks

Subtext also has a shortcut for linking to local pages, called "slashlinks". Slashlinks are like `#hashtags`, or `@mentions` except instead of starting with a `#` or an `@`, they start with a `/`, like this: `/link`

Here are some examples of slashlinks:

```
This is a /slashlink. A few more:

/evolution
/requisite-variety
/DesignPatterns
```

Slashlinks can't include spaces. It is considered good practice to use dashes `-` instead. Also, slashlinks are case-insensitive. That is, `/Evolution` and `/evolution` reference the same thing. Feel free to write whatever looks better to you.

```
/whole-earth-catalog, a collection of /DIY books and tools.
```

Slashlinks can also include hierarchical sub-parts, just like a URL. This can be useful when two concepts from different fields share the same name.
